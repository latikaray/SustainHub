## AI Heuristic Methods in SustainHub

SustainHub employs applied AI techniques and heuristic approaches to provide intelligent recommendations and sustainability insights. These methods are lightweight, interpretable, and efficient for industry applications. The following systems are implemented:

### 1. Rule-based Heuristic System
Fixed rules and multipliers are defined for parameters such as **waste volume, plan type, and waste type**.  

**Example:**  
- `wasteVolume = "50-100"` ‚Üí 75 kg baseline  
- `pricingPlan = "premium"` ‚Üí 2.2x multiplier  

This approach represents a classic **expert system** in AI, where domain knowledge is encoded into rules.  

---

### 2. Weighted Scoring Algorithm (Multi-Criteria Decision Making)
For each buyer, a **match score** is calculated based on weighted criteria:  
- Location Score ‚Üí 30%  
- Price Score ‚Üí 40%  
- Reliability Score ‚Üí 30%  

This constitutes a **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** system, a commonly used method in recommender systems.  

---

### 3. Recommendation System Logic (Top-N Selection)
The scoring system identifies the **top 3 buyers** as recommendations.  
This process‚Äî**filter ‚Üí rank ‚Üí select**‚Äîforms the core of recommendation engines.  

**Predictive Estimation (Heuristic Forecasting)**
- Simulates current vs. potential trade values using multipliers and averages.  
- Generates **growth projections (% annually)** within realistic bounds using heuristic randomization.  

---

### 4. Environmental Impact Scoring (Expert System + Thresholds)
SustainHub also evaluates **environmental impact** by assigning a **Green Score** based on:  
- Base score (60)  
- Waste volume multiplier  
- Plan multiplier  
- Waste type bonus  

Impact levels are classified into categories such as **‚ÄúRevolutionary‚Äù** or **‚ÄúExceptional.‚Äù**  
This represents a **rule-based classification system**, a lightweight yet effective AI method.

---

### Conclusion
SustainHub bridges the gap between industries and sustainable waste management by providing intelligent buyer recommendations and transparent impact scoring. By simplifying decision-making and introducing the Green Score, it empowers organizations to improve their sustainability credibility and align with ESG goals.  

Future enhancements, such as AI-driven waste classification and advanced analytics, will further strengthen the platform‚Äôs value.  
We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration to make SustainHub a leading solution in sustainable innovation.
